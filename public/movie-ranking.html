<hr />
<h3>Troy</h3>
<p>This elite film with Brad Pitt was so good, it made me dislike Orlando Bloom anytime he is not Legolis.</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>I was a young man wathcing this film and it made me think of how we are living a circular world if we let it stay like that.</p>
<h3>Lion King</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film. It honestly open my eyes to what pride really is as a kid.</p>
