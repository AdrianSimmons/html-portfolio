<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello world, my name is Adrian Simmons. I am your local website developer, bartender and family man but whatever you call me, just be nice.
  I look at the word like I do my code, anything is possible with a little bit of time. Today is 8/8/2025 and year from now I would love to become elite in my coding craft.
  I have goals of completing atleast 5 free websites for associates of mine to show them how to create a more powerful platform to expand thier brand and mine as well.
  Today is a day of consistency, tomorrow will be a repeat of yesterday. Life is sweet and full of avenues and curves to go around, let today be the first day of the best time of your life.
</p>

<p>Born and raised in Boston Ma, I have done sales, finacial services, fast food, banking, customer service, bartending, farming, managment, and operations
  Having such a diverse background and up bringing, I am able to take all the flavors of my past and make a delicious gumbo of life ahead of me.
